# A fictional CVR report representing votes for President of the U.S. and
# Governor of New York as conducted in a New York state precinct in 1912. The
# report is describes an election in which votes are cast on paper ballots and
# "scanned". It assumes that BallotStudio is doing the "scanning".
'@type': CVR.CastVoteRecordReport
# Election definition.
# Records here will be referenced by their '@id' in the CVR records.
# Cast Vote Records track the actual decisions made by a voter during an election.
#
# - The record types all begin with 'CVR'. When the rest of the name matches to
#   an election definition type (e.g. 'Contest' and 'CVRContest') then the CVR
#   record is referring to the election definition record by ID.
# - All these CVRs represent the original marked ballot, so each of them has
#   only one snapshot. 'CurrentSnapshotId' is always 'snapshot-01'.
# - Many of the fields of a CVR don't matter for plurality/majority voting
#   be cause thecan only be one vote per contest selection.
# - 'CVR records don't have an '@id'. They have 'UniqueId' which is unique for
#   each CVR in the report.
# - Pay particular attention to 'SelectionPosition'. This is where most of the
#   complexity of CVRs is.
