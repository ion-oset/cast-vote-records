### Election Summary / Specification

The Jetsons live in Orbit City, in Gadget County.

The Gadget County Elections Board runs elections for the electoral district that is the county itself, as well as the 2 jurisdictions within the county:

1. _Orbit City_ with its `City Council` and `Mayor`
2. The _SpacePort District_, with its `SpacePort Control Board` that regulates the use of the SpacePort and who supervise staff activity to collect landing fees and use funds for SpacePort upkeep.

There are 4 precincts in the County:

1. The _Downtown Precinct_ is the part of the county that’s in Orbit City but not in the SpacePort District.
2. The _SpaceTown Precinct_ is the part of the county that’s both in Orbit City and the SpacePort District.
3. The _Port Precinct_ is the part of the county that’s in the SpacePort District but not in Orbit City.
4. The _Bedrock Precinct_ is the part of the county that’s in neither Orbit City nor the SpacePort District (named for a predecessor town that archaeologists found traces of in the remote part of the county).

All residents of the county can vote in elections for any seat on the `Gadget County Board of Supervisors`, and also any county-level ballot question. The residents of the Bedrock Precinct can only vote for the ballot question. In addition to county voting, residents of the Downtown and SpaceTown Precincts can vote for `Orbit City Council` and `Orbit City Mayor`, and any city-level ballot question. In addition to county voting, residents of the SpaceTown Precinct and Port Precinct can for vote for the `SpacePort Control Board`.

An upcoming special election has been called because the mayor, the venerable Montague Jetson, recently announced early retirement. Two candidates are running for the seat:

1. _Cosmo Spacely_
2. _Spencer Cogswell_

Since each had to resign his seat on `SpacePort Control Board` in order to run for Mayor, there are two open seats on the Board, and 3 candidates running:

1. _Jane Jetson_
2. _Harlan Ellis_
3. _Rudi Indexer_
 
In addition, the Gadget County Board of Supervisors have placed a `ballot question on raising the county sales tax`. The text of the ballot question is:

> “Shall Gadget County increase its sales tax from 1% to 1.1% for the purpose of raising additional revenue to fund expanded air traffic control operations?”

and the answers are `“Yes”` and `“No”`.

The ballots in the upcoming election, therefore, are:

- _Bedrock Precinct_:
    - `County ballot question 1`
- _Port Precinct_:
    - `SpacePort Control Board`
    - `County ballot question 1`
- _SpaceTown Precinct_:
    - `Orbit City Mayor`
    - `SpacePort Control Board`
    - `County ballot question 1`
- _Downtown Precinct_:
    - `Orbit City Mayor`
    - `County ballot question 1`

Orbit City elections are partisan contests, with Spacely in the _Lepton Party_, and Cogswell in the _Hadron Party_. Both of them are listed on the ballot with the party affiliation. SpacePort Control Board elections are non partisan, and candidates are listed by profession rather than party: Jane as "Independent Consultant", Harlan as "Author", and Rudi as "Sentient Search Engine". Both contests include a write-in option.
